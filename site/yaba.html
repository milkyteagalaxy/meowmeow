 	<article>My favorite song right now is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xbokCesviM" target="_blank" title="BARKBAKRBKAOWOOFWOFNAKBFIOWFBD">やば。by Fujii Kaze</a>. He is a very pog singer and songwriter. The title roughly translates to "yikes" in English, which, along with the music itself, makes me feel like it's about losing your mind because you love someone so despite all the shit they're going through. This song makes me lose my fucking mind.</article>

<p>Hmm, hmm</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Verse 1]</p>
<p>Wanna get noticed, wanna get approved</p>
<p>These were only intentions</p>
<p>Wanna be rewarded, wanna be loved</p>
<p>That wasn't love at all</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Verse 2]</p>
<p>I sought, searched, found and lost</p>
<p>But I still keep chasing that pipe dream</p>
<p>You'd better go somewhere far away</p>
<p>Up up and away</p>
<p>Open your eyes and</p>
<p>Fly as high as you can</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>You've been into the grave so many times</p>
<p>You've prayed to the lord so many times</p>
<p>Yikes, yikes, yikes, yikes</p>
<p>Then why do you hurt me?</p>
<p>Why do you let mе down?</p>
<p>What about those loving days we used to sharе</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Post-Chorus]</p>
<p> don't say anything anymore</p>
<p>'Cause I'm never gonna hurt you</p>
<p>I'm never gonna let you down</p>
<p>Ever again, ever again, ever again, ever again</p>
<p>Ever again, ever again, ever again, ever again</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Verse 3]</p>
<p>"It's no use saying anything, it's too late"</p>
<p>Bet this is something you never expect to hear from me</p>
<p>I know you've lived in a cheap dream</p>
<p>Thinking the same thing happens over and over again</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
<p>Why don't we go there together?</p>
<p>I never ever give up on anybody</p>
<p>I'm here for you as long as you want</p>
<p>As long as you want</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>You've been into the grave so many times</p>
<p>You've prayed to the lord so many times</p>
<p>Yikes, yikes, yikes, yikes</p>
<p>Then why do you hurt me?</p>
<p>Why do you let me down?</p>
<p>What about those loving days we used to share</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Post-Chorus]</p>
<p>Please don't say anything anymore, yeah</p>
<p>'Cause I'm never gonna hurt you</p>
<p>I'm never gonna let you down aah</p>
<p>Ever again, ever again, ever again, ever again, ever again</p>
<p>Ever again, ever again, aah</p>
<p>Ever again, ever again, ever again, ever again</p></article></center>
