 	<article>My favorite song right now is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xbokCesviM" target="_blank" title="BARKBAKRBKAOWOOFWOFNAKBFIOWFBD">やば。by Fujii Kaze</a>. He is a very pog singer and songwriter. The title roughly translates to "yikes" in English, which, along with the music itself, makes me feel like it's about losing your mind because you love someone so despite all the shit they're going through. This song makes me lose my fucking mind.</article>
